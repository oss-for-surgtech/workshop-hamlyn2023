## Introduction
Open-source software libraries for computer assisted surgery (e.g. Scikit-surgery, 3DSlicer, MITK, PLUS, CustusX, FAST and KitwareMedical) have shown great progress in the last twenty years due to their rapid innovation and adaption to new technologies, continuous release of open software and data for algorithm evaluation, and good documentation and educational resources for students, researchers, engineers and clinicians.

However, research-driven technologies bring challenges on the use of the latest generation of hardware; fast prototyping and validation of new algorithms; fragmented source code for heterogenous systems; high performance of medical image computing and visualisation in the operating room and standardisation of data quality and data privacy. Such challenges raise the question of how to make open-source software libraries more sustainable, long-term supported and translatable to the clinic. This workshop aims to bring together engineers, researchers and clinicians to present and to discuss current progress, challenges and trends on open-source software interfaces for Surgical Technologies.

## Learning Outcomes
Participants of the workshop will be exposed to leading authors of state-of-the-art open-source platforms for Surgical Technolgies aiming to have the following learning outcomes:
* Developing open-source software interfaces including best practices of software engineering (e.g. maintenance, sustainability, etc) to create clinical impact.
* Good practices for clinical translation including best practices to integrate preoperative and intraoperative data (e.g., tracking systems and clinical hardware), and protocols to handle clinical data for computer assisted surgical technologies.
* Discussions on trends and the future of Surgical Technologies: how to quickly adopt the latest technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, augmented reality, high-performance computing, etc) while still complying with relevant quality standards.
