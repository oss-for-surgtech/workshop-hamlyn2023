## SlicerROS2: ROS for Medical Robots
This talk will focus on a software platform called SlicerROS2, which was built to support the research and development of image-guided robotic systems. SlicerROS2 is part of a multi-center, multi-national effort to create a central development platform for medical robotics research and is supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) R01EB020667 (MPI: Tokuda, Krieger, Fuge, Leonard). This presentation will be used to demonstrate the capabilities of this new platform and open discussion for next steps and potential use-cases.
