## Biography 
Miguel is a Research Engineer at University College London within the Advanced Research Computing Centre and Wellcome and the EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS) where he is advancing AI-based Surgical Navigation tools. Previously, he was a Research Associate at King’s College London (KCL) within the School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences where in the Vietnam ICU Translational Applications Laboratory (VITAL) project, he scientifically contributed to automatic biometric recognition from Cardiac ultrasound data using deep learning techniques. Similarly, he pushed forward the state-of-the-art of ultrasound-guided procedures in the Guided Instrumentation for Fetal Therapy and Surgery (GIFT-Surg) project where he scientifically contributed to the development of new algorithms, software, hardware and medical device quality management system and public engagement activities. All the previous activities in collaboration with renowned clinicians, engineers and researchers in KCL, UCL and University of Oxford.

Before joining KCL, he was awarded a Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Birmingham in July 2019 where he investigated Nonlinear Analysis to Quantify Movement Variability in Human-Humanoid Interaction. His PhD thesis (https://mxochicale-phd.github.io/site/) is the first open-accessible and reproducible thesis since the establishment of the University of Birmingham. Prior to this, based in México, he was a research assistant in the Robotics laboratory at INAOE where he worked on service robotics. In 2006, he received his M.Sc. in Signal Processing at INAOE and in 2004 a B.Sc. in Electronic Engineering at Puebla Institute of Technology.

Miguel’s research currently focuses on developing data-centric AI tools for Medical Imaging, MedTech, SurgTech, Biomechanics and clinical translation. He has passion for generative models for fetal imaging, sensor fusion data with wearables and medical imaging, real-time AI for echocardiography, image-guided procedures, AI-based surgical navigation, child-robot interaction in low resource countries and open-science.
